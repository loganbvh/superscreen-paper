              applications, ranging from traditional geometry processing to
              more recent 3D content management. In this scenario, spectral
              methods are extremely promising as they provide a natural library
              of tools for shape analysis, intrinsically defined by the shape
              itself. In particular, the eigenfunctions of the
              Laplace--Beltrami operator yield a set of real-valued functions
              that provide interesting insights in the structure and morphology
              of the shape. In this paper, we first analyze different
              discretizations of the Laplace--Beltrami operator (geometric
              Laplacians, linear and cubic FEM operators) in terms of the
              correctness of their eigenfunctions with respect to the
              continuous case. We then present the family of segmentations
              induced by the nodal sets of the eigenfunctions, discussing its
              meaningfulness for shape understanding.",

               extraction for complex multi-terminal three-dimensional
               structures from current distributions calculated by FastHenry is
               discussed. Results for both a reflection plane modelling an
               infinite ground plane and a finite segmented ground plane that
               allows inductive elements to extend over holes in the ground
               plane are shown. Several SQUIDs were designed for and fabricated
               with IPHT's 1 kA cm − 2 RSFQ1D niobium process. These SQUIDs
               implement a number of loop structures that span different
               layers, include vias, inductively coupled control lines and
               ground plane holes. We measured the loop inductance of these
               SQUIDs and show how the results are used to calibrate the layer
               parameters in InductEx and verify the extraction accuracy. We
               also show that, with proper modelling, FastHenry can be fast
               enough to be used for the extraction of typical RSFQ cell

              technology used to produce ultra low noise tunnel junction dc
              SQUIDs is employed to achieve tight coupling between the SQUID
              loop and and the input coil. In our scheme the planar,
              ungroundplaned, inductive loop of the dc SQUID acts as the wide
              single turn primary of a thin-film transformer. The input coil
              consists of a multiple-turn secondary in the form of a spiral
              stripline fabricated directly above the primary. The two tunnel
              junctions are located at the outside edge of the SQUID loop. A
              low inductance stripline structure connects the junctions to the
              region of high current flow in the SQUID loop. We have evaluated
              this coupling scheme experimentally in SQUIDs with 10-turn,
              19-turn, 50-turn, and 100-turn input coils. All have mutual
              inductances per turn of approximately 80 pH, in good agreement
              with numerical calculations. Detailed measurements on the 50-turn
              SQUID gave a mutual inductance M of 3.8 nH, an input coil
              inductance Liof 190 nH, a SQUID self inductance of L of 89 pH,
              and a coupling constant k2= M2/LiL of 0.86. The 100- turn version

              has excellent magnetic field sensitivity, but suffers from modest
              spatial resolution when compared with other scanning probes. This
              spatial resolution is determined by both the size of the field
              sensitive area and the spacing between this area and the sample
              surface. In this paper we describe scanning SQUID susceptometers
              that achieve sub-micron spatial resolution while retaining a
              white noise floor flux sensitivity of
              $\approx$2$\mu$$\Phi$0/Hz1/2. This high spatial resolution is
              accomplished by deep sub-micron feature sizes, well shielded
              pickup loops fabricated using a planarized process, and a deep
              etch step that minimizes the spacing between the sample surface
              and the SQUID pickup loop. We describe the design, modeling,
              fabrication, and testing of these sensors. Although sub-micron
              spatial resolution has been achieved previously in scanning SQUID
              sensors, our sensors not only achieve high spatial resolution but

              planes. The Pearl lengths (Lambda=2lambda(2)(L)/d, lambda(L) the
              London penetration depth, d the superconducting film thickness)
              in these samples, as determined by fits to the vortex images,
              agree with those by local susceptibility measurements, and can be
              as long as 1 mm. The in-plane penetration depths lambda(ab)
              inferred from the Pearl lengths are longer than many bulk
              cuprates with comparable critical temperatures. We speculate on
              the causes of the long penetration depths, and on the possibility
              of exploiting the unique properties of these superconductors for
              basic experiments.",

               planarized process with eight niobium layers developed at MIT
